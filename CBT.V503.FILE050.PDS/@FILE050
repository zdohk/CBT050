//***FILE 050 is an Internet Surfing file, which contains some      *   FILE 050
//*           URL addresses for MVS-related sites on the Internet.  *   FILE 050
//*           This file is intended to make looking for tools a     *   FILE 050
//*           little easier.  Sometimes, a good tool is available   *   FILE 050
//*           on the Internet, but for some reason, it isn't a      *   FILE 050
//*           good candidate to put on the CBT Tapes themselves.    *   FILE 050
//*           This file is therefore intended as a pointer, to      *   FILE 050
//*           help you get these materials yourself.                *   FILE 050
//*                                                                 *   FILE 050
//*           File 050 lists sites which have free software         *   FILE 050
//*           that is dowloadable, whereas File 051 lists some      *   FILE 050
//*           software vendor sites.                                *   FILE 050
//*                                                                 *   FILE 050

//*           Please bear in mind that this file is only intended   *   FILE 050
//*           to get you started, and in practice, it is very hard  *   FILE 050
//*           (or next to impossible) to keep it up to date.  You   *   FILE 050
//*           have to surf, and then translate the HTML into text.  *   FILE 050
//*           Takes too much time for a busy Sysprog who has to     *   FILE 050
//*           update the CBT Tape too.                              *   FILE 050
//*                                                                 *   FILE 050
//*           Nevertheless, I think it is valuable, for pointing us *   FILE 050
//*           Systems Programmers to some places on the net, where  *   FILE 050
//*           we can get some good information.                     *   FILE 050
//*                                                                 *   FILE 050

//*           No responsibility is assumed by anybody connected     *   FILE 050
//*           with the CBT Tape materials, for anything that was    *   FILE 050
//*           downloaded by anybody from any of these sites.        *   FILE 050
//*           These sites are not under our control, and they may   *   FILE 050
//*           change at any time.  The URL's to get there, are      *   FILE 050
//*           provided, just so that people can find out about      *   FILE 050
//*           those materials, to determine if they are useful      *   FILE 050
//*           to them.  We do not guarantee in any way, that any    *   FILE 050
//*           URL's will stay up-to-date.                           *   FILE 050
//*                                                                 *   FILE 050
//*           Actually, the purpose for creating this file, is to   *   FILE 050
//*           let people know about materials that are specifically *   FILE 050
//*           NOT on the CBT Tape in the form that they are in.     *   FILE 050
//*           Either they belong to somebody, or are copyrighted by *   FILE 050
//*           somebody, but the bottom line is that somebody else   *   FILE 050
//*           controls them.  It is understood that there is no     *   FILE 050
//*           implied or explicit responsibility assumed by any     *   FILE 050
//*           individual or corporate entity having to do with the  *   FILE 050
//*           CBT Tape materials in any way, concerning anything    *   FILE 050
//*           obtained at these sites, in the past or in the        *   FILE 050
//*           future.  Use all of these materials at your own       *   FILE 050
//*           risk, or don't use them at all.                       *   FILE 050
