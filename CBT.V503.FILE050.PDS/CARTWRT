MVS FREEWARE ON THE WEB   -   Dave Cartwright's list as of 10/19/99
=======================

  Checked over (04/28/04) by Sam Golob.  Most of these have been
  verified to exist, but not all.  Web sites change......

The greatest site for free MVS software on the web is of course the
home page for the CBT Tape;
 http://www.cbttape.org/

If you are lucky enough to work for a company that subscribes the
one of the XEPHON Update periodicals you will be able to download
recent programs.  They have kindly made the archives accessible to
everyone, there is a lot of older code there which is still useful.
 http://www.xephon.com/down1.html

There are a lot of IBM sites with downloads available. These are
being updated frequently, so I will not list them. Start from one of
the main IBM sites and see what you can find
(Hint: look at RACF and Unix System Services).

Other vendors give away MVS Freeware, try;
 http://www.dignus.com/
and many others.

David Pitts has ported the GCC and EGCS compilers to USS. His site

Make sure you read the instructions.

Another general interest site with downloads on it is at

It appears to be the personal site of Mike Muuss <mike@arl.mil>

If you like ISRDDN, take a look at the website of the guy who wrote
it, Doug Nadel;

This is the site where you can find TASID.

You can download Michael A. Newell's brilliant PDS2PDS dialog from;
 File 649 of the CBT Tape.   http://www.cbttape.org/ftp/cbt/CBT649.zip
I cannot speak too highly of this contribution.

Gerard Nicol can be contacted at:
 gerard.nicol@tapetrack.com  Files 323 and 324 of the CBT Tape
contain his REXX Function Pack.

Mike Porter has a site at;
 http://manatee.nss.udel.edu/

David Elder-Vass has put a lot of his book about Systems Programming
onto the web at;
 http://www.mvsbook.fsnet.co.uk/index.htm

I had a lot of trouble with the frames on Nigel Pentland's site at
 http://www.cairnleck.co.uk/nigel/
but the RACF link did take me to a page of RACF downloads, although
I haven't tried them.

Sam Knutson
 http://www.cbttape.org
has a lot of links to freeware sites which he updates faster than I
can update this list!


Rob Scott has some downloads at
 http://www.rocketsoftware.com/portfolio/mxi/index.htm
which includes his MXI system information tool.

There does not appear to be any shareware at
 http://www.rexxla.org/index.html
but it's a good site to bookmark if you are looking for hints and
tips on the REXX language.

Thierry Falissard's Home Page at
 http://www.os390-mvs.freesurf.fr/
is one of those sites that gets indexed from lots of other places.
Because it's good.  He has not got much of his own freeware there,
but he has a lot of links to other freeware sites.  He does have
documentation for IPOUPDTE, which is becoming hard to find, so
thanks, Thierry.

download his latest work from;
